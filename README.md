# k3p

A `k3s` packager and installer, primarily intended for airgapped deployments

For documentation on `k3p` usage, see the [command docs here](doc/k3p.md).

## TODO:

- API Port is hard coded in a lot of places, need to make `k3p install --api-port=` available across the board.
- Per node configs

## Quickstart

Will publish releases via actions in the future. For now, on a system with `git` and `go` installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tinyzimmer/k3p
cd k3p
make install

# If you do not have make installed, you can build and install manually with:
cd cmd/k3p
go build -o $(go env GOPATH)/bin/k3p .
```

You can build a package with the `build` command. By default it will scan your current directory, and
detect objects to be included in the archive. See the usage documentation for other configuration options.

```bash
$ k3p build

```

You can optionally exclude images for the archive, however this is not the default behavior as this project was originally intended
for fully airgapped deployments. Any raw kubernetes `yaml` or `helm` charts found (that are not excluded) will be included and applied
automatically upon installation.

You can then install the package to a system using the `install` command. Installations can be performed either on the local system (requires root),
over a remote SSH connection (requires SSH user have passwordless `sudo`), or to docker containers on the local system similar to [`k3d`](https://github.com/rancher/k3d).

Again, see the usage documentation for more configuration options, and how to use the various installation modes, but to just install to the local system:

```bash
# Will work on any linux system (and WSL2 using genie)

For further information on adding worker nodes and/or setting up HA, you can view the command documentation, 
however more complete documentation will come in the future in the form of [examples](examples/).
